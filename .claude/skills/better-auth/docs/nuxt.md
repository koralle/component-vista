# Nuxt Integration

Copy MarkdownOpen in

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation.html).

### [Create API Route](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#create-api-route)

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a file inside `/server/api/auth` called `[...all].ts` and add the following code:

server/api/auth/[...all].ts

```
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth"; // import your auth config

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
	return auth.handler(toWebRequest(event));
});
```

You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`

### [Migrate the database](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#migrate-the-database)

Run the following command to create the necessary tables in your database:

```
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

## [Create a client](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#create-a-client)

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

auth-client.ts

```
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/vue" // make sure to import from better-auth/vue

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive.

### [Example usage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#example-usage)

index.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
import { authClient } from "~/lib/client"
const session = authClient.useSession()
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <button v-if="!session?.data" @click="() => authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: 'github'
        })">
            Continue with GitHub
        </button>
        <div>
            <pre>{{ session.data }}</pre>
            <button v-if="session.data" @click="authClient.signOut()">
                Sign out
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```

### [Server Usage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#server-usage)

The `api` object exported from the auth instance contains all the actions that you can perform on the server. Every endpoint made inside Better Auth is a invocable as a function. Including plugins endpoints.

**Example: Getting Session on a server API route**

server/api/example.ts

```
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
      headers: event.headers
    });

   if(session) {
     // access the session.session && session.user
   }
});
```

### [SSR Usage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#ssr-usage)

If you are using Nuxt with SSR, you can use the `useSession` function in the `setup` function of your page component and pass `useFetch` to make it work with SSR.

index.vue

```
<script setup lang="ts">
import { authClient } from "~/lib/auth-client";

const { data: session } = await authClient.useSession(useFetch);
</script>

<template>
    <p>
        {{ session }}
    </p>
</template>
```

### [Middleware](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/integrations/nuxt.html#middleware)

To add middleware to your Nuxt project, you can use the `useSession` method from the client.

middleware/auth.global.ts

```
import { authClient } from "~/lib/auth-client";
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to, from) => {
	const { data: session } = await authClient.useSession(useFetch);
	if (!session.value) {
		if (to.path === "/dashboard") {
			return navigateTo("/");
		}
	}
});
```
