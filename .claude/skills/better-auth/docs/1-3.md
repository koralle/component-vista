## [🚀 Highlights](https://www.better-auth.com/blog/1-3.html#-highlights)

auth.ts

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    sso({
      oidc: {
        clientId: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_ID!,
        clientSecret: process.env.OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET!,
      },
      saml: {
        entryPoint: "https://example.com/saml",
        issuer: "better-auth-example",
        certificate: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
      },
      providersLimit: async (user) => {
        const plan = await getUserPlan(user);
        return plan.name === "pro" ? 10 : 1;
      },

import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import { auth } from "./auth";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  // pass your auth instance to infer additional fields
  plugins: [organizationClient({ $inferAuth: {} as typeof auth })],
});
```

---

### [**Additional Organization Fields**](https://www.better-auth.com/blog/1-3.html#additional-organization-fields)

        invitation: { additionalFields: { /* ... */ } },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Other new options:
