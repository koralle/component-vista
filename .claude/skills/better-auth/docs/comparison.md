# Comparison

> Comparison is the thief of joy.

Here are non detailed reasons why you may want to use Better Auth over other auth libraries and services.

### [vs Other Auth Libraries](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/comparison.html#vs-other-auth-libraries)

* **Framework agnostic** - Works with any framework, not just specific ones
* **Advanced features built-in** - 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session, rate limiting, and many more
* **Plugin system** - Extend functionality without forking or complex workarounds
* **Full control** - Customize auth flows exactly how you want

### [vs Self-Hosted Auth Servers](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/comparison.html#vs-self-hosted-auth-servers)

* **No separate infrastructure** - Runs in your app, users stay in your database
* **Zero server maintenance** - No auth servers to deploy, monitor, or update
* **Complete feature set** - Everything you need without the operational overhead

### [vs Managed Auth Services](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/comparison.html#vs-managed-auth-services)

* **Keep your data** - Users stay in your database, not a third-party service
* **No per-user costs** - Scale without worrying about auth billing
* **Single source of truth** - All user data in one place

### [vs Rolling Your Own](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/comparison.html#vs-rolling-your-own)
