# Admin

Copy MarkdownOpen in

The Admin plugin provides a set of administrative functions for user management in your application. It allows administrators to perform various operations such as creating users, managing user roles, banning/unbanning users, impersonating users, and more.

## [Installation](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#installation)

### [Add the plugin to your auth config](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#add-the-plugin-to-your-auth-config)

To use the Admin plugin, add it to your auth config.

auth.ts

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { admin } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... other config options
    plugins: [
        admin()
    ]
})
```

### [Migrate the database](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#migrate-the-database)

Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

migrategenerate

npmpnpmyarnbun

```
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

npmpnpmyarnbun

```
npx @better-auth/cli generate
```

See the [Schema](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#schema) section to add the fields manually.

### [Add the client plugin](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#add-the-client-plugin)

Next, include the admin client plugin in your authentication client instance.

auth-client.ts

```
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { adminClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        adminClient()
    ]
})
```

## [Usage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#usage)

Before performing any admin operations, the user must be authenticated with an admin account. An admin is any user assigned the `admin` role or any user whose ID is included in the `adminUserIds` option.

### [Create User](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#create-user)

Allows an admin to create a new user.

#### [Query Filtering](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#query-filtering)

The `listUsers` function supports various filter operators including `eq`, `contains`, `starts_with`, and `ends_with`.

#### [Pagination](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#pagination)

The `listUsers` function supports pagination by returning metadata alongside the user list. The response includes the following fields:

```
{
  users: User[],   // Array of returned users
  total: number,   // Total number of users after filters and search queries
  limit: number | undefined,   // The limit provided in the query
  offset: number | undefined   // The offset provided in the query
}
```

##### [How to Implement Pagination](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#how-to-implement-pagination)

To paginate results, use the `total`, `limit`, and `offset` values to calculate:

* **Total pages:** `Math.ceil(total / limit)`
* **Current page:** `(offset / limit) + 1`
* **Next page offset:** `Math.min(offset + limit, (total - 1))` – The value to use as `offset` for the next page, ensuring it does not exceed the total number of pages.
* **Previous page offset:** `Math.max(0, offset - limit)` – The value to use as `offset` for the previous page (ensuring it doesn’t go below zero).

##### [Example Usage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#example-usage)

Fetching the second page with 10 users per page:

admin.ts

```
const pageSize = 10;
const currentPage = 2;

const users = await authClient.admin.listUsers({
    query: {
        limit: pageSize,
        offset: (currentPage - 1) * pageSize
    }
});

const totalUsers = users.total;
const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalUsers / pageSize)
```

## [Access Control](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#access-control)

The admin plugin offers a highly flexible access control system, allowing you to manage user permissions based on their role. You can define custom permission sets to fit your needs.

### [Roles](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#roles)

By default, there are two roles:

`admin`: Users with the admin role have full control over other users.

`user`: Users with the user role have no control over other users.

A user can have multiple roles. Multiple roles are stored as string separated by comma (",").

### [Permissions](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#permissions)

By default, there are two resources with up to six permissions.

**user**:
`create` `list` `set-role` `ban` `impersonate` `delete` `set-password`

**session**:
`list` `revoke` `delete`

Users with the admin role have full control over all the resources and actions. Users with the user role have no control over any of those actions.

### [Custom Permissions](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#custom-permissions)

The plugin provides an easy way to define your own set of permissions for each role.

#### [Create Access Control](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#create-access-control)

You first need to create an access controller by calling the `createAccessControl` function and passing the statement object. The statement object should have the resource name as the key and the array of actions as the value.

permissions.ts

```
import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

/**
 * make sure to use `as const` so typescript can infer the type correctly
 */
const statement = {
    project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
} as const;

const ac = createAccessControl(statement);
```

#### [Create Roles](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#create-roles)

Once you have created the access controller you can create roles with the permissions you have defined.

permissions.ts

```
import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

export const statement = {
    project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"], // <-- Permissions available for created roles
} as const;

const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

export const user = ac.newRole({
    project: ["create"],
});

export const admin = ac.newRole({
    project: ["create", "update"],
});

export const myCustomRole = ac.newRole({
    project: ["create", "update", "delete"],
    user: ["ban"],
});
```

When you create custom roles for existing roles, the predefined permissions for those roles will be overridden. To add the existing permissions to the custom role, you need to import `defaultStatements` and merge it with your new statement, plus merge the roles' permissions set with the default roles.

permissions.ts

```
import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";
import { defaultStatements, adminAc } from "better-auth/plugins/admin/access";

const statement = {
    ...defaultStatements,
    project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
} as const;

const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

const admin = ac.newRole({
    project: ["create", "update"],
    ...adminAc.statements,
});
```

#### [Pass Roles to the Plugin](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#pass-roles-to-the-plugin)

Once you have created the roles you can pass them to the admin plugin both on the client and the server.

auth.ts

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { admin as adminPlugin } from "better-auth/plugins"
import { ac, admin, user } from "@/auth/permissions"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        adminPlugin({
            ac,
            roles: {
                admin,
                user,
                myCustomRole
            }
        }),
    ],
});
```

You also need to pass the access controller and the roles to the client plugin.

auth-client.ts

```
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { adminClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
import { ac, admin, user, myCustomRole } from "@/auth/permissions"

export const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        adminClient({
            ac,
            roles: {
                admin,
                user,
                myCustomRole
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

### [Access Control Usage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#access-control-usage)

**Has Permission**:

To check a user's permissions, you can use the `hasPermission` function provided by the client.

ClientServer

POST

/admin/has-permission

```
const { data, error } = await authClient.admin.hasPermission({    userId: "user-id",    permission: { "project": ["create", "update"] } /* Must use this, or permissions */,    permissions,});
```

| Prop | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userId?` | The user id which you want to check the permissions for. | `string` |
| `permission?` | Optionally check if a single permission is granted. Must use this, or permissions. | `Record<string, string[]>` |
| `permissions?` | Optionally check if multiple permissions are granted. Must use this, or permission. | `Record<string, string[]>` |

POST

/admin/has-permission

```
const data = await auth.api.userHasPermission({    body: {        userId: "user-id",        role: "admin", // server-only        permission: { "project": ["create", "update"] } /* Must use this, or permissions */,        permissions,    },});
```

| Prop | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userId?` | The user id which you want to check the permissions for. | `string` |
| `role?`(server-only) | Check role permissions. | `string` |
| `permission?` | Optionally check if a single permission is granted. Must use this, or permissions. | `Record<string, string[]>` |
| `permissions?` | Optionally check if multiple permissions are granted. Must use this, or permission. | `Record<string, string[]>` |

Example usage:

auth-client.ts

```
const canCreateProject = await authClient.admin.hasPermission({
  permissions: {
    project: ["create"],
  },
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canCreateProjectAndCreateSale = await authClient.admin.hasPermission({
  permissions: {
    project: ["create"],
    sale: ["create"]
  },
});
```

If you want to check a user's permissions server-side, you can use the `userHasPermission` action provided by the `api` to check the user's permissions.

api.ts

```
import { auth } from "@/auth";

await auth.api.userHasPermission({
  body: {
    userId: 'id', //the user id
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
    },
  },
});

// You can also just pass the role directly
await auth.api.userHasPermission({
  body: {
   role: "admin",
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
    },
  },
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
await auth.api.userHasPermission({
  body: {
   role: "admin",
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
      sale: ["create"]
    },
  },
});
```

**Check Role Permission**:

Use the `checkRolePermission` function on the client side to verify whether a given **role** has a specific **permission**. This is helpful after defining roles and their permissions, as it allows you to perform permission checks without needing to contact the server.

Note that this function does **not** check the permissions of the currently logged-in user directly. Instead, it checks what permissions are assigned to a specified role. The function is synchronous, so you don't need to use `await` when calling it.

auth-client.ts

```
const canCreateProject = authClient.admin.checkRolePermission({
  permissions: {
    user: ["delete"],
  },
  role: "admin",
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canDeleteUserAndRevokeSession = authClient.admin.checkRolePermission({
  permissions: {
    user: ["delete"],
    session: ["revoke"]
  },
  role: "admin",
});
```

## [Schema](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#schema)

This plugin adds the following fields to the `user` table:

| Field Name | Type | Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| role | string | ? | The user's role. Defaults to `user`. Admins will have the `admin` role. |
| banned | boolean | ? | Indicates whether the user is banned. |
| banReason | string | ? | The reason for the user's ban. |
| banExpires | date | ? | The date when the user's ban will expire. |

And adds one field in the `session` table:

| Field Name | Type | Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| impersonatedBy | string | ? | The ID of the admin that is impersonating this session. |

## [Options](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#options)

### [Default Role](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#default-role)

The default role for a user. Defaults to `user`.

auth.ts

```
admin({
  defaultRole: "regular",
});
```

### [Admin Roles](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#admin-roles)

The roles that are considered admin roles when **not** using custom access control. Defaults to `["admin"]`.

auth.ts

```
admin({
  adminRoles: ["admin", "superadmin"],
});
```

**Note:** The `adminRoles` option is **not required** when using custom access control (via `ac` and `roles`). When you define custom roles with specific permissions, those roles will have exactly the permissions you grant them through the access control system.

**Warning:** When **not** using custom access control, any role that isn't in the `adminRoles` list will **not** be able to perform admin operations.

### [Admin userIds](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#admin-userids)

You can pass an array of userIds that should be considered as admin. Default to `[]`

auth.ts

```
admin({
    adminUserIds: ["user_id_1", "user_id_2"]
})
```

If a user is in the `adminUserIds` list, they will be able to perform any admin operation.

### [impersonationSessionDuration](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#impersonationsessionduration)

The duration of the impersonation session in seconds. Defaults to 1 hour.

auth.ts

```
admin({
  impersonationSessionDuration: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
});
```

### [Default Ban Reason](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#default-ban-reason)

The default ban reason for a user created by the admin. Defaults to `No reason`.

auth.ts

```
admin({
  defaultBanReason: "Spamming",
});
```

### [Default Ban Expires In](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#default-ban-expires-in)

The default ban expires in for a user created by the admin in seconds. Defaults to `undefined` (meaning the ban never expires).

auth.ts

```
admin({
  defaultBanExpiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
});
```

### [bannedUserMessage](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#bannedusermessage)

The message to show when a banned user tries to sign in. Defaults to "You have been banned from this application. Please contact support if you believe this is an error."

auth.ts

```
admin({
  bannedUserMessage: "Custom banned user message",
});
```

### [allowImpersonatingAdmins](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/admin.html#allowimpersonatingadmins)

Whether to allow impersonating other admin users. Defaults to `false`.

auth.ts

```
admin({
  allowImpersonatingAdmins: true,
});
```
